# Several models are relatively easy to visualize in terms of their fit or performance. Here are a few examples: 
# 1. Linear Regression: Visualizing the fit of a linear regression model is straightforward. 
# Scatter plots with the regression line can show how well the line fits the data points. 
# Residual plots display the difference between observed and predicted values, helping assess model adequacy. 
# 2. Decision Trees: Decision trees are inherently visual models. The tree structure itself can be visualized 
# to understand how the model makes decisions based on features. 
# 3. Random Forests: Similar to decision trees, random forests’ ensemble nature can be visualized by examining multiple decision trees’ 
# combined predictions or feature importance measures. 
# 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM): While the decision boundary in high-dimensional space isn’t easily visualized, in two dimensions, 
# SVM can display the separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. 
# 5. Neural Networks: Visualizations like activation maps, weight distributions, or model architecture diagrams can offer insights into 
# how a neural network processes information through its layers. 
# 6. K-means Clustering: For clustering models, visualizations such as 
# scatter plots with cluster assignments or cluster centroids help in understanding how data points are grouped. 
# 7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA reduces the dimensionality of data. Visualizing this reduction onto lower dimensions 
# (e.g., 2D or 3D scatter plots) helps understand how much variance is captured. 
# 8. Gradient Boosting: Similar to random forests, visualization of boosting models involves examining multiple weak learners’ combined 
# impact on predictions. Visualizations of model fit vary based on the complexity and nature of the model. Techniques like plotting decision 
# boundaries, feature importance, residuals, or model-specific attributes help visualize how well the model captures patterns or relationships within the data.
