# Certainly! Combining model fitting with dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) can be a 
# powerful approach, 
# especially for visualizing and understanding high-dimensional data within the context of predictive modeling. 
# Here’s an example using R, combining logistic regression (as a simple model) with PCoA for visualization using the “iris” dataset: 

# Load required libraries 
#library(vegan) # For PCoA --- tried to use pcoa function, doesn't exist
library(ggplot2) # For visualization 
library(ecodist) # so used pco function from this package that does exist
# Load the iris dataset 
data(iris) 
# Perform PCoA 
iris_dist <- dist(iris[, 1:4]) # Calculate distance matrix 
iris_pcoa <- pco(iris_dist) # Perform PCoA 
# Combine PCoA results with species information 
pcoa_data <- data.frame(iris_pcoa$vectors, Species = iris$Species) 
# Fit a logistic regression model 
logit_model <- glm(Species ~ ., data = pcoa_data, family = "binomial") 
# Predict probabilities using the model 
pcoa_data$predicted <- predict(logit_model, newdata = pcoa_data, type = "response") 
# Visualize PCoA with model predictions 
ggplot(pcoa_data, aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = predicted)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(color = "Predicted Probability") + 
  theme_minimal() 

# Explanation: 1. Load Libraries: We load the necessary libraries (vegan for PCoA and ggplot2 for visualization). 
# 2. Perform PCoA: We compute the distance matrix for the iris dataset and perform PCoA. 
# 3. Combine PCoA Results: PCoA results are combined with species information from the iris dataset. 
# 4. Fit Logistic Regression Model: We fit a logistic regression model to predict the species based on the PCoA axes. 
# 5. Predict Probabilities: Using the logistic regression model, we predict probabilities for the species based on the PCoA coordinates. 
# 6. Visualize PCoA with Model Predictions: We create a scatter plot using PCoA axes and color points based on the predicted probabilities 
# from the logistic regression model. This example demonstrates how PCoA can be used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of data, 
# while also incorporating a predictive model (logistic regression in this case) to understand how well the model predicts outcomes within the reduced space.
